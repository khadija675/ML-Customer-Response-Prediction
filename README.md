Predicting Customer Response to Marketing Campaigns
This repository contains my machine learning project for the CM-651 (Machine Learning) course, supervised by Syed Muhammad Meesum Abbas.

📁 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to respond to a marketing campaign, using the Customer Personality Analysis Dataset from Kaggle.

✅ Key Highlights
Performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing

Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and answer business questions

Engineered new features such as customer age, family size, and total spending to improve model performance

Built and evaluated multiple classification models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Derived actionable business insights and recommendations to support marketing strategies
